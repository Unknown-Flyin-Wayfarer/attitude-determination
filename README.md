### attitude determination
#### components used are Raspberry Pi pico and BMX160 IMU
#### finds out the orientation and represents in Euler angles and Quarternions using TRIAD algorithm
##### TODO : transfer the quarternion or Euler to openGL simulation code throough serial port to visualize the orientation. Code is working but error with serial port
